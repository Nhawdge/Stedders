## Introduction

Stedders is a game made for [Mech Jam 4](https://itch.io/jam/mechjam4). 
Very heavily inspired by the episode [Suits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-HTc0Z6oEs) from Love Death and Robots (on netflix, it's like 20 minutes, and amazing).
The basic gist is that you've got a mech to do farming during the day, and at night the aliens come and you've got to swap your farming tools for weapons and do simple wave defense and protect the crops.
