Bugs and stuff:
* [ ] When you have lasers equipped, and press the Barn's "open" button to swap equipment, you fire off a laser
    * Low priority
* [ ] The area tha detects when you can buy does not cover the whole barn, not a big deal but some players may not think the barn is interactable if they try to touch just a corner of the barn to swap equipment.
    * Low priority
* [ ] Note: I played a second time, and it's actually kinda hard to trigger the zone in some cases (the biomass house trigger zone is good).
    * Maybe will fix
* [ ] I tried to sell biomass with no biomass in the inventory, then I tried going over to the barn, and could no longer trigger the barn zone (not suuuper sure about this one, maybe I couldn't just trigger the zone in general when I tried to move over it).
* [ ] The throttle meter bar goes to half when full stopping
* [ ] The blue UI background in the top left does not adjust its size to accommodate for the equipped equipment.
* [ ] I noticed in the debug console, that some monsters "belly" variable can go past 100%, I let it run, and it went over 233%
* [ ] Just an fyi, as i'm not sure if these variables should go into the negative, but flee sometimes jumps to -10
* [ ] When harvesting biomass, the "Biomass: 0/100" indicator works, but it displays a float that will jitter like crazy when getting to a whole number.
* [ ] After playing the game around 4 times, and letting the monsters eat all the crops, one of them started moving down the road, and flipping it's position left to right like crazy, not sure if it was just 2 monsters clipped into each other until it stopped lol

### Other stuff: (may or may not be implemented yet, and comments):

* [ ] There is no game over when all crops are eaten.
* [ ] Where is no button to bring the player back to the main menu to complete the loop
* [ ] The player can move off of the map
* [ ] The purple monster dudes are very cool, I like their bobbing animations, especially the buck teeth that give them a little character.


Recommendations:

* Maybe just an icon above the barn door, giving the player a visual cue that it's the barn (also adjust the zone for when the shop button triggers)
* What causes the mech's head to move? There are some times when I am just fixated on the mech, and not the line indicating the direction he moves, and sometimes the head position messes up my thoughts on where the mech is going to go (maybe i'm just weird too) Edit: Facepalm moment.. It's the mouse position lol
* When equipping both lasers, the laser beams overlap, making it a little misleading that I am firing two lasers
* Maybe adding an ammo indicator to the lasers in the shop so the players can get figure out which laser is near empty without having to equip it first
